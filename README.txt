Ansible-scripts
===========
This is a short ansible script that you can use to install linux, apache, php, and mysql. in order to use it you need to have Ansible installed on the machine that you are going to be working on. You are also going to need a few other things that you can find at:

You are also going to need to use ssh to do anything in Ansible, so there is that to keep in mind.
